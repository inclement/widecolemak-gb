Wide Colemak
############

An xkb language file for gb, with the addition of a widecolemak
layout, the same as colemak with right hand keys shifted one space to
the right. 

There are maybe better ways to add a new layout, but this is simple
and works, at least on an international keyboard layout (not sure where
BKSL moves on a US layout).
